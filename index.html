                In this highly influential silent horror film, the mysterious Count Orlok (Max Schreck) summons Thomas Hutter to his remote Transylvanian castle in the mountains. The eerie Orlok seeks to buy a house near Hutter and his wife, Ellen. After Orlok reveals his vampire nature, Hutter struggles to escape the castle, knowing that Ellen is in grave danger. Meanwhile Orlok's servant, Knock, prepares for his master to arrive at his new home.

            <em>
                In reality, I thought I would be bored with this film. After watching it, now I see the reason why it became a classic in the horror genre... This is why you should never judge a film from it's era...

            By it's an atmospheric, terrifying, and sometimes shocking horror film of the last century. This black and white film has been a surprising treasure in the horror genre. This has illustrates the gothic aesthetic from characters, props, settings and much. In which, adds a newer aspect to the movie as a whole. I might also add, the different dark tones of where the movie is set in a specific scene, the placement of the plague, the creepy stories of Count-Orlok, and much more.
            <br><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 50px;"></span>These are the few reasons why I love this film, demonstrating the benefits of how gothic films work, and how this inspires newer sub-genre of monsters and mythology. Impacting the viewer with the terrifying details of the antagonist Count-Orlok. I must say, Max Schreck did an amazing job of becoming Count-Orlok and be this disturbing figure that I must applaud him. Is easy to just add make-up or special effects to the actor itself, which, not often, becomes odd, and sometimes unnecessary to have the dedication to have the actor become the protagonist/antagonist that deserves recognition. The characters in this film fit perfectly with the theme as well. To the often disturbing and oftentimes odd actions of Ellen. To the unpredictable and extremely irregular movements of Knock. This film redefined what an actor can improve and fulfill the film in many ways. Without the exaggerated actions of many of these characters, we wouldn't have this dark tone we see in a black and white horror film, or in general in the fact. Once again, I must applaud the people behind the cameras with the limited technology given in the last century.
            <br><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 50px;"></span>The ominous and daunting sheet music has added a greater level in what the film can reveal and what we can anticipate in the next scene. Sneakily adding the minor chords of the orchestra, and the strong staccato of the organs as the main instrument in the majority of the soundtrack. This has greatly impacted me not only from the tone but as well from how the theme works out with this sheet music. This made me rethink back on the idiotic music I've made back then, not being original...
            <br><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 50px;"></span>The star of the film, and arguably the most important of any film modern or old, the story. Well enough that I understand the dialogue, the pan flip, the characters emotions, and the motives of the antagonist has been clear as day. Which is why became more memorable, and why many consider this a classic. I would add, the Plague was an interesting integration, fitting perfectly on what the motive of the story is looking out for. Being dark. That is what gothic film is about, demonstrating the dar side of real-life, there is no happy ending. Which a switch on a mood on what I recently been looking at.
            <br><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 50px;"></span>In conclusion, Nosferatu is an amazing gem of horror cinema I've seen in a while. Through the stories dark tone and the integration of the Plague, to the most amazing cast of characters that reaches the needed capabilities of what we can define as "horror film". This changed my perspective on what gothic film impacted the silent film era. Plus, this impacted me greater on what we can do with the limited technology. From the realistic Count-Orlok, which fun fact, he is! Schreck has been now, one of my favorite method actors ever now. To the eerie and unpleasant orchestra in any film, I've heard. I now consider this a major classic that anybody interested in horror or how monsters and creature popularize, this is a must-watch!
